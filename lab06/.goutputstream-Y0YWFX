/* Problem # 1
You can choose 4 keys that chooses through 3 with m possible buckets, so the resulting answer will be 
[4(m-1)/m^3] */


/* Problem #6.
int hash(const string & key, int tableize)
{
    return (key[0] + 27*key[1] + 729*key[2]) % tablesize;
}



int hash(const string & key, int tablesize)
{
    int hashval = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i<key.length(); i++)
        hashval += key[ i ];
        
    return hashval % tablesize ;
}

The con of the the first function is that the algorithm is the same for every
string. This will most likely cause many functions to have the same key value.
It also assumed that the string, key, is at least a size of 3 which is a con.

The con of the second function is the map size is constant. Since it will
never expand, it is bound to have collisions eventually. This may also
potentially lead to slower runtime.
