Assn 3 is compilable. 
I did not do Node::height and Node::size because I didn't use it for my tree functions.

I spent most of my time trying to figure out how to make pre-post and in order functions
to work.
I was able to complete all of the required tree functions with private helper functions.

When you use search, it returns either 1(TRUE) or 0(FALSE)

When you use [], it will return the value of the number. If you go out of bounds,
it will display an error message then exit the program.

pre-post and in order functions should work.

Size will display the total size of the actual tree.
